### Protecting integrity with file permissions
#### Getting to know file permissions
Open a terminal console (such as Konsole from KDEMenu ? Applications ? System ? Konsole).

Start by creating a file with some content. Run:

```bash
sudo bash -c 'cat > /var/log/mylogfile'
```
> (Type some content, then press Ctrl-D to finish and return to the
prompt.)

Look at the details of the file:

```bash
ls -la /var/log/mylogfile
```
``
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 20 Feb 7 17:38 /var/log/mylogfile
``

As we can see above, the file is owned by root, who has read-write access.

Exploring Unix file permissions further is outside the scope of this lab, but will be covered elsewhere.
